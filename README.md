# Utiliser concept
A proof of concept to show a potential process of generating utility classes from traditional CSS. Inspired by Chris Coyier on [Shop talk show podcast](https://shoptalkshow.com/447/).

## Notes
`notes.md` has the process of the concept outlined. All files in `/src` and `/build` have been manually made to identify potential problems.
